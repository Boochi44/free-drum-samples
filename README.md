# Free Drum Samples

This repository provides three curated drum kits for hip‑hop and trap production. Each kit contains royalty‑free one‑shot samples organised by instrument type (kicks, 808s, snares, claps, hi‑hats, open hats, percussion and effects). The kits are designed to work with a 16‑pad drum machine or browser‑based beat maker.

## Kits

### 01 Hard Trap

Distorted 808s with long sustain, heavy kicks, crisp snares and dark textures inspired by Metro Boomin, Southside and 808 Mafia. Ideal for hard trap or drill beats.

### 02 Bounce

Round, clean 808s, tight kicks and snappy claps reminiscent of West Coast and Mustard‑style bounce. A balanced kit for upbeat hip‑hop.

### 03 Soulful Vintage

Warm, vinyl‑textured drums derived from TR‑808 samples processed through down‑sampling and bit‑crushing to emulate SP‑1200/MPC grit. Great for soul, boom‑bap or vintage hip‑hop.

## Licensing & attribution

All samples in this repository are released under the **Creative Commons Zero (CC0 1.0)** license. You are free to use, modify and redistribute the samples in personal and commercial projects without attribution.

Many of the one‑shots were derived from the **TR‑808** sample set created by Edward Loveall and published in the `tidalcycles/sounds‑tr808‑fischer` repository, which is licensed CC0【490384358966562†L66-L83】. Additional 808 bass tones were synthesised using sine waves and waveshaping distortion, and the vintage kit was created by down‑sampling and bit‑crushing the original TR‑808 sounds. The hard trap kit features long, distorted 808 basses and processed percussions; the bounce kit uses clean, round 808s and crisp drums; the soulful kit uses lofi processing for vintage texture.

No attribution is required, but if you wish to credit the original TR‑808 sample library you may include the following:
